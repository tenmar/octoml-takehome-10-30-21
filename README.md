# Afterword

I was not versed nor did I know any Vue.js before receiving the take home assignment, I thought that before I began, I could learn the basics of Vue and complete the assignment in the alotted time. Although I was able to complete the assignment, I took a couple hours longer than the suggested time of 4 hours, and I don't believe I was able to follow the best practices of Vue as much as I might have been to with something I am far more familiar with (like React).

If I had more time, I would have liked to guess what a loading state for the app might look like and also what a non-browser alert of the optimization might look like. Furthermore, I would have liked to have understood Vue enough to organize the code better and to handle some value-update-events a bit more cleanly than I did. I made my choices with how I approached this, and they are as they are.
